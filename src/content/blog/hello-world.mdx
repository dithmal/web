Hello, world!

Have you noticed the world never says hello back? That's okay, though, here I am, saying hello again, to a world that never says hello back, just like at the start of every coding tutorial.

So, I've decided to start writing and documenting my thoughts and experiences. I don't have any concrete ideas on what to write (or what not to), so buckle up.

Until then, Goodbye, world! ðŸŽ¤ðŸ«³
